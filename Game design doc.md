# 🎮 Game Design Document – Reverse Dictionary Game

## 1. **Game Overview**

* **Title (Working)**: *WordQuest: Reverse Dictionary*
* **Genre**: Word / Puzzle
* **Platform**: Android (Google Play, later iOS optional)
* **Target Audience**: Casual players (ages 12+), puzzle lovers, trivia fans
* **Core Idea**: Instead of being given letters, the game gives players a clue (definition, riddle, or emoji hint). The player must guess the correct word.

---

## 2. **Core Gameplay Loop**

1. Player starts a round → sees a **clue** (text definition, emoji combo, or riddle).
2. Player types in a guess.

   * If correct → big celebration animation + reward coins.
   * If incorrect → gentle nudge (“Try again!”).
3. If stuck → player can:

   * Spend coins for a hint (reveal a letter).
   * Watch an ad for a hint or to skip the puzzle.
   * Buy hint packs with real money.
4. Progression → after solving X puzzles, unlocks new theme packs (e.g., Animals, Space, Food).

---

## 3. **Game Modes**

* **Classic Mode** – play level by level, increasing difficulty.
* **Daily Challenge** – one special word per day with extra rewards (encourages daily logins).
* **Emoji Mode** – puzzles are just emojis (“🌍🔥” = “Global Warming”).
* **Riddle Mode** – short riddles players solve by guessing the word.
* **Themed Packs** – purchasable content (e.g., “Holiday Words,” “Famous Movies”).

---

## 4. **Reward System**

* **Coins** – earn coins per correct word. Used for hints/skips.
* **Achievements** – badges for milestones (e.g., “10 Long Words,” “Guess 100 Words”).
* **Streak Bonuses** – daily streak = extra coins + multiplier.
* **Collections** – completing categories (Animals, Foods, etc.) gives big rewards.

---

## 5. **Monetization**

1. **Ads**

   * Rewarded ads:

     * Reveal a letter / skip a puzzle.
     * Extra daily spin.
   * Interstitial ads: after every 5–7 puzzles.
2. **In-App Purchases (IAPs)**

   * \$0.99 – 10 hints.
   * \$2.99 – Remove ads forever.
   * \$1.99–\$4.99 – Themed puzzle packs.
   * \$0.99–\$9.99 – Coin bundles.
3. **Optional Premium Pass**

   * Monthly \$3.99 subscription → daily hints, no ads, exclusive puzzles.

## 6. **Difficulty & Progression**

* Early levels: simple, common words (“dog,” “car,” “happy”).
* Mid-levels: trickier definitions, multiple-meaning words.
* Advanced levels: abstract concepts or riddles.
* Difficulty auto-adjusts: if a player fails 3 times, give them easier words to keep engagement.

---

## 7. **UI/UX Style**

* Clean, modern, minimalistic (like Wordscapes or Word Connect).
* Bright colors, smooth animations, confetti when solving.
* One-hand play optimized (easy for commuters).
* Font should be **large and legible** (important for older players too).

---

## 8. **Social Features**

* Leaderboards → “Fastest Daily Solver” or “Longest Streak.”
* Share solved puzzles with friends (“I solved today’s word in 8 seconds!”).
* Optional invite-a-friend reward (extra coins).

---

## 9. **Technical Scope (MVP)**

* Android app built in Unity or Flutter.
* SQLite or Firebase backend for saving progress.
* Puzzle database (can start small with \~1,000 words/clues).
* Optional: daily puzzles synced from server (easy future update).

---

## 10. **Post-Launch Expansion Ideas**

* Seasonal word packs (Halloween, Summer, Olympics).
* Multiplayer “Guess Race” mode (real-time duel).
* User-generated puzzles (players make riddles → community solves).
* AI-assisted clue generation (to keep fresh puzzles coming forever).

---

# ✅ Summary

This game is **fun, rewarding, and monetizable** because:

* People *hate being stuck* → they’ll watch ads or buy hints.
* Daily challenges & streaks keep players engaged long-term.
* Puzzle packs & themes create recurring micro-purchases.
