Heck yeah, Big Bad Bob‚Äîhere are **copy-paste prompts** you can give to any LLM to (1) generate puzzle content, (2) QA/clean it, (3) convert/merge formats, and (4) spit out code, store text, and translations. I also included **step-by-step instructions** so you can run this as a repeatable pipeline.

---

# How to use these prompts (quick guide)

1. Pick a task below ‚Üí copy the prompt ‚Üí fill the üî∑ placeholders.
2. Ask the LLM to **return output in a single fenced code block**.
3. **Generate in batches** (e.g., 50‚Äì100 puzzles) to keep it clean.
4. Run the **QA/Validator prompt** on the result.
5. Save to file and test in your app.
6. Rinse & repeat for more packs (Movies/TV, Holiday, Idioms, etc.).

# A) Master Puzzle Generator (JSON)

**Use this to create any pack: definitions, emoji, riddles‚Äîmixed or themed.**

**Prompt:**

```
You are a senior puzzle designer for a Reverse Dictionary word game.
TASK: Generate üî∑<COUNT> puzzles as JSON that follow this schema:

{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "packs": [{
    "pack_id": "üî∑<PACK_ID>",
    "name": "üî∑<PACK_NAME>",
    "description": "üî∑<PACK_DESCRIPTION>",
    "puzzles": [
      {
        "id": "üî∑<PACK_PREFIX>-0001",
        "type": "definition|emoji|riddle",
        "clue": "string",
        "answer": "string (lowercase, no trailing spaces)",
        "alt_answers": ["list","of","synonyms or variants"],
        "category": "üî∑<CATEGORY or THEME>",
        "difficulty": 1|2|3,
        "length": int(answer length),
        "hints": ["short","useful"],
        "tags": ["topic","mode"],
        "points": 10|12|14   // scale with difficulty: 10(easy) / 12(med) / 14(hard)
      }
    ]
  }]
}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Distribution by type: üî∑<TYPE_DISTRIBUTION> (e.g., 40% definition, 40% emoji, 20% riddle).
- Difficulty mix: üî∑<DIFFICULTY_DISTRIBUTION> (e.g., 50% d1, 35% d2, 15% d3).
- All answers must be UNIQUE (case-insensitive) within the pack.
- Keep emoji puzzles to ‚â§ 3 emojis (4 max if truly needed).
- Hints must be short, non-spoilery, and helpful.
- Avoid offensive or NSFW content.
- Accept common variants via alt_answers (spelling, hyphenation, plural/singular).
- For multi-word answers, use spaces (e.g., "global warming"). No punctuation at the end.
- Categories and tags must be consistent with the theme: üî∑<THEME_NOTES>.
- If a clue could match multiple answers, disambiguate the clue.

OUTPUT:
- Return JSON ONLY in one code-fenced block (no commentary).
- IDs should be sequential (üî∑<PACK_PREFIX>-0001, -0002, ...).
```

# B) Emoji-Only Generator (premium packs love these)

**Prompt:**

```
Create üî∑<COUNT> emoji-only puzzles as JSON for pack üî∑<PACK_ID> ("üî∑<PACK_NAME>").
Theme: üî∑<THEME> (e.g., Movies & TV, Idioms, Holiday Foods).

Rules:
- clue = 2‚Äì3 emojis (max 4 if needed).
- Each emoji sequence must strongly imply a single real answer.
- Include 2 short hints that describe the idea without revealing the exact answer.
- difficulty: mostly 1‚Äì2, a few 3 for clever combos.
- alt_answers: include natural variants (e.g., "spider-man" vs "spiderman").

Use the schema from the Master Puzzle Generator and output JSON only.
```

---

# C) Riddle-Only Generator

**Prompt:**

```
Generate üî∑<COUNT> short riddles as JSON for pack üî∑<PACK_ID> ("üî∑<PACK_NAME>").
Audience: 12+ casual mobile players.
Rules:
- Riddles must be solvable in <30s by a typical player.
- Avoid reused classics unless you paraphrase them; target fresh wording.
- One unambiguous answer per riddle; add alt_answers for common synonyms.
- Provide 2 concise hints.

Use the schema from the Master Puzzle Generator and output JSON only.
```

---

# D) Themed Pack Generator (e.g., Idioms & Sayings)

**Prompt:**

```
Create üî∑<COUNT> puzzles for the premium pack üî∑<PACK_ID> ("üî∑<PACK_NAME>") with theme "üî∑Idioms & Sayings".
Types: 60% emoji (idioms via emoji), 25% definition (meaning of idiom), 15% riddle (clues pointing to the idiom).
Examples of answers: "break the ice", "piece of cake", "spill the beans", etc.
Each puzzle:
- For emoji type, prefer 2‚Äì3 emojis that evoke the idiom metaphorically (not literal translations).
- alt_answers should include common punctuation/space variants.
- Hints should nudge the metaphor (‚Äúsocial opener‚Äù, ‚Äúvery easy task‚Äù, ‚Äúreveal a secret‚Äù).
Use the standard JSON schema; output JSON only.
```

---

# E) QA / Validator / Deduplicator (run AFTER generation)

**Prompt:**

```
You are a strict content QA bot. I will paste a JSON pack following this schema (packs[0].puzzles[*]).
TASKS:
1) Validate JSON structure and required fields.
2) Enforce rules:
   - Unique 'answer' across puzzles (case-insensitive).
   - difficulty in {1,2,3}; points aligned to difficulty (10/12/14).
   - hints are short and helpful; alt_answers aren‚Äôt duplicates of answer.
   - emoji puzzles have ‚â§3 emojis (4 max).
   - riddle clues have a single, unambiguous solution.
3) Identify issues:
   - duplicates, ambiguous clues, unsafe or NSFW content, factual errors.
   - overly obscure answers for casual audience.
4) FIXES:
   - For minor issues, return a corrected JSON.
   - For ambiguous/duplicate items that can‚Äôt be salvaged, remove them and list their IDs in a "removed" array.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "report": {
    "errors": [...],
    "warnings": [...],
    "removed_ids": [...]
  },
  "fixed": { /* corrected JSON pack, same schema */ }
}

Return one fenced code block containing valid JSON only.
```

# F) JSON ‚Üí SQLite Converter (LLM rewrite)

**Prompt:**

```
Convert this JSON pack into SQL INSERT statements for two tables:

packs(pack_id, name, description)
puzzles(id, pack_id, type, clue, answer, alt_answers, category, difficulty, length, hints, tags, points, is_active)

Notes:
- alt_answers, hints, tags should be JSON strings (escaped) suitable for TEXT columns.
- Use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING where applicable (if supported).
- Ensure pack row is inserted first.
- Return a single fenced code block with SQL only (no commentary).
```

---

# G) Merger / Normalizer (combine multiple packs safely)

**Prompt:**

```
Merge these N JSON packs into ONE consistent pack list:
- Keep original pack_id/name/description.
- For each pack, ensure puzzles have unique IDs and unique 'answer's within that pack.
- If an answer collides across packs, DO NOT change existing packs; only rename the new ID (not the answer) and leave a "note" in a separate 'collisions' section of the final report.
- Normalize fields:
  - lowercase 'answer'
  - compute 'length' from answer
  - points = 10/12/14 by difficulty
Return one code-fenced JSON with:
{
  "report": { "collisions": [...], "summary": { "total_packs": X, "total_puzzles": Y } },
  "data": { "version": "1.0.0", "packs": [...] }
}
No prose.
```

# H) Unity Loader + Systems (code generator)

**Prompt:**

```
Write Unity C# scripts for an Android word game:

FILES:
1) PuzzleModels.cs ‚Äì serializable classes for Puzzle, Pack, Root.
2) PuzzleRepository.cs ‚Äì loads packs from StreamingAssets (JSON), validates, indexes by id, random sampler by type/difficulty, and daily-challenge selector seeded by local date.
3) GameLoop.cs ‚Äì shows clue, accepts text input, checks answer (case-insensitive, trims), awards coins, reveals letter (cost coins), skip (cost coins), and supports rewarded-ad callbacks (placeholder methods).
4) Economy.cs ‚Äì simple coin balance (PlayerPrefs), cost constants, grant on correct answers, streak bonus logic.
5) Settings.cs ‚Äì difficulty preferences and accessibility flags (large font).
6) AdShim.cs ‚Äì AdMob placeholders: ShowRewarded(string reason), ShowInterstitialEveryNLevels(int N). Implement events but leave TODOs for real ad unit IDs.
7) IAPShim.cs ‚Äì Google Play Billing placeholders: PurchaseRemoveAds(), PurchaseHintPack(int amount), PurchasePack(string packId). Include success/failure callbacks.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, compilable code with namespaces.
- No external assets; comment where AdMob/IAP SDK calls go.
- Minimal UI stubs (public fields for TextMeshProUGUI, Buttons).
Return all files concatenated in ONE fenced code block, with clear // --- FILE: headers.
```

---

# I) Flutter Loader + Systems (code generator)

**Prompt:**

```
Write Flutter/Dart code for an Android word game:

FILES:
- models.dart (Puzzle, Pack, Root with fromJson)
- repo.dart (load asset JSON, cache packs, random sampler, daily challenge by date seed)
- game_logic.dart (check answers, hint/skip economy, streaks)
- ad_shim.dart (stubs for google_mobile_ads rewarded/interstitial)
- iap_shim.dart (stubs for in_app_purchase purchases)

Constraints: Pure Dart (no platform channels yet), functions that I can later wire to UI. Return all files in a single fenced code block.
```

---

# J) Store Listing & Screenshots Copy

**Prompt:**

```
Create Google Play store text for "WordQuest: Reverse Dictionary":
- 30-char Title options (x5)
- 80-char Short description options (x5)
- 400‚Äì700 char Full description (x2 variants)
- 7 bullet points of features
- 10 SEO keywords/phrases

Tone: fun, clever, family-friendly. Emphasize daily challenge, hints, and premium packs. Output as clean Markdown only.
```

---

# K) Localization (optional)

**Prompt:**

```
Localize this pack to üî∑<LANGUAGE> for casual players:
- Translate 'clue' and 'hints' only.
- Keep 'answer' and 'alt_answers' in the target language; if the concept lacks a natural translation, replace with a culturally equivalent, short, common word/phrase and note the substitution in a "notes" array alongside the puzzle ID.
- Preserve emoji as-is.
Return the modified JSON with an added "lang": "üî∑<LANGUAGE_CODE>" at root.
```

---

## Step-by-step workflow (repeatable)

1. **Plan the pack**

   * Theme, count, type split, difficulty mix.

2. **Generate content**

   * Use **A or B/C/D** with your settings (50‚Äì100 per batch).

3. **Validate & fix**

   * Run **E (QA/Validator)** on the JSON. Save the fixed result.

4. **Merge**

   * If combining multiple outputs, run **G (Merger/Normalizer)**.

5. **Convert (optional)**

   * If you want SQLite inserts, run **F**.

6. **Wire into app**

   * Use **H (Unity)** or **I (Flutter)** to produce scaffolding.
   * Drop JSON into assets/StreamingAssets and test a small flow.

7. **Monetization**

   * Fill AdMob IDs in `AdShim`.
   * Set ‚Äúevery 5‚Äì7 puzzles‚Äù interstitial.
   * Add IAP products in Play Console, then wire in `IAPShim`.

8. **Store listing**

   * Use **J** for text; make 6‚Äì8 screenshots (mock UI is fine to start).

9. **Localization (optional)**

   * Use **K** to create one additional language (e.g., Spanish) and ship as a differentiator.

10. **Ship**

* Closed test ‚Üí open testing ‚Üí production.
* Track retention & ad views; adjust difficulty and hints.
