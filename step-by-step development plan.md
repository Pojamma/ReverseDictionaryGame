# üöÄ Step-by-Step Development Plan

## **Phase 1: Prototype & Core Gameplay**

1. **Choose Your Dev Environment**

   * **Unity** (C#) ‚Üí Best for scalability, ads, and cross-platform.
   * **Flutter** (Dart) ‚Üí Easier for mobile UI, but ads & game logic can be trickier.
   * **Godot** (GDScript) ‚Üí Lightweight, open source.

   üëâ Recommendation: Start with **Unity** (lots of tutorials + ad SDKs are plug-and-play).

2. **Core Game Loop Prototype**

   * Hardcode \~20 puzzles (word + clue pairs).
   * Show one clue at a time.
   * Input box for guesses.
   * Correct = ‚ÄúCongrats‚Äù popup + coins.
   * Incorrect = shake animation + try again.

3. **Hints & Rewards**

   * Button: ‚ÄúReveal Letter‚Äù ‚Üí cost coins OR watch ad (stub this for now).

Big Bad Bob, do you want me to next **draft the actual puzzle database format** (like a JSON/SQL structure with examples of definitions, emojis, and riddles) so you‚Äôd have ready-to-use content for the prototype?
