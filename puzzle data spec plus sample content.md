Awesome‚Äîhere‚Äôs a **ready-to-use puzzle data spec** plus sample content you can drop into your prototype. I included **JSON** (easy to ship in-app or via Firebase) and an **SQLite schema** (nice for scale + updates). You also get \~35 mixed puzzles across **definition / emoji / riddle** with categories and difficulties.

# 1) JSON Format (recommended for MVP)

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "packs": [
    {
      "pack_id": "base",
      "name": "Base Pack",
      "description": "Core puzzles for all modes.",
      "puzzles": [
        {
          "id": "base-0001",
          "type": "definition",              // definition | emoji | riddle
          "clue": "A word meaning extremely happy.",
          "answer": "ecstatic",
          "alt_answers": ["overjoyed"],
          "category": "vocabulary",
          "difficulty": 1,                   // 1=easy, 2=medium, 3=hard
          "length": 8,
          "hints": ["Starts with 'ec-'", "Think: beyond happy"],
          "tags": ["emotion","adjective"],
          "points": 10
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fields**

* `type`: `definition` | `emoji` | `riddle`
* `alt_answers`: accept synonyms/variants
* `difficulty`: 1‚Äì3 (keep tuning live)
* `hints`: surfaced for coins/ads
* `points`: scoring weight (you can scale by difficulty)

# 2) SQLite Schema (drop-in)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS packs (
  pack_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS puzzles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  pack_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES packs(pack_id),
  type TEXT CHECK(type IN ('definition','emoji','riddle')) NOT NULL,
  clue TEXT NOT NULL,
  answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  alt_answers TEXT DEFAULT '[]',        -- JSON array as text
  category TEXT,
  difficulty INTEGER CHECK(difficulty BETWEEN 1 AND 3) DEFAULT 1,
  length INTEGER,
  hints TEXT DEFAULT '[]',              -- JSON array as text
  tags TEXT DEFAULT '[]',               -- JSON array as text
  points INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);

-- Example inserts
INSERT INTO packs (pack_id,name,description) VALUES
('base','Base Pack','Core puzzles for all modes')
ON CONFLICT(pack_id) DO NOTHING;
```

# 3) Sample Content (drop-in JSON)

> Save as `puzzles_base.json`. You can merge/add packs later (seasonal, movies, science, etc.).

# 4) Quick Loader Snippets

### Unity C# (Resources JSON)

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class Puzzle {
  public string id, type, clue, answer, category;
  public string[] alt_answers, hints, tags;
  public int difficulty, length, points;
}
[System.Serializable]
public class Pack {
  public string pack_id, name, description;
  public Puzzle[] puzzles;
}
[System.Serializable]
public class PuzzleRoot {
  public string version;
  public Pack[] packs;
}

public class PuzzleLoader : MonoBehaviour {
  public PuzzleRoot Data;
  void Awake() {
    TextAsset json = Resources.Load<TextAsset>("puzzles_base"); // put puzzles_base.json in Assets/Resources
    Data = JsonUtility.FromJson<PuzzleRoot>(json.text);
  }
}
```

### Flutter/Dart (assets JSON)

```dart
class Puzzle {
  final String id, type, clue, answer, category;
  final List<String> altAnswers, hints, tags;
  final int difficulty, length, points;

  Puzzle.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> j)
    : id = j['id'],
      type = j['type'],
      clue = j['clue'],
      answer = j['answer'],
      category = j['category'] ?? 'general',
      altAnswers = List<String>.from(j['alt_answers'] ?? []),
      hints = List<String>.from(j['hints'] ?? []),
      tags = List<String>.from(j['tags'] ?? []),
      difficulty = j['difficulty'] ?? 1,
      length = j['length'] ?? j['answer']?.toString().length ?? 0,
      points = j['points'] ?? 10;
}
```

# 5) Content Tips (for growth)

* **Accept synonyms** via `alt_answers` generously (improves retention).
* Flag ambiguous answers early from analytics and add them to `alt_answers`.
* Rotate **Daily Challenge** by sampling from `difficulty=2` with a small chance of `3`.
* Add **seasonal packs** (e.g., `pack_id: holiday-2025`) so you can sell/feature them without an app update if you fetch remotely.
